## Idea ##
Vexillology is the scientific study of the history, symbolism and usage of flags or, by extension, any interest in flags in general. A game is structured form of play, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. This app aims to teach fun facts about flags using gamification methodology.

## Target Audience ##
A person who studies flags is a vexillologist; vexillography is the art of designing flags; one who does so is a vexillographer; an admirer of flags is a vexillophile. My aim is to engage audience in a fun learning experience and eventually turning them into vexillophile. I am trying to target a broader age group from school kids to senior citizens.

## Features ##

 - **Flag of the week** : FTW is like giving history of the particular flag including its origin, symbolism, design, type.
 
 - **Fwag, Not a Fwag** : A rapid fire game where flag cards are flashed in front of user and user has to answer it within a limited time frame.
 -  **Vexillophile** : This aims to teach user the basic terminologies about flags via quizzes. User will be rewarded flags after
mastering each topic.
